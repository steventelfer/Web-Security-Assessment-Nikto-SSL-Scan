## Web Security Assessment: Nikto & SSL Scan

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of web application security, combining Nikto for web server scanning and SSL scanning to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web servers and SSL/TLS certificates.

### Skills Learned:
- Utilization of Nikto for automated web server scanning and vulnerability assessment.
- Conducting SSL/TLS security scans to assess the cryptographic strength and configuration of SSL/TLS certificates.
- Interpretation of scan results to identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities and SSL/TLS issues.

### Tools Used:
- Nikto: An open-source web server scanner for identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web servers.
- SSL Scanner: A tool for conducting SSL/TLS security scans to assess the cryptographic strength and configuration of SSL/TLS certificates.

### Steps:
1. Nikto Setup:
   - Install and configure Nikto on your local machine or server environment for web application security assessments.

2. Target Application Identification:
   - Identify the target web applications or websites for assessment, specifying the scope and objectives of the security assessment.

3. Automated Web Server Scanning with Nikto:
   - Perform automated vulnerability scans using Nikto to identify common security issues in web servers, such as outdated software versions, misconfigured server settings, and potentially vulnerable scripts or files.

4. SSL/TLS Security Scanning:
   - Conduct SSL/TLS security scans to assess the cryptographic strength and configuration of SSL/TLS certificates used by the target web servers. Identify any SSL/TLS-related vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weaknesses that may pose security risks.

5. Vulnerability Analysis and Prioritization:
   - Analyze the scan results generated by Nikto and the SSL scanner to identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities, SSL/TLS issues, and potential risks. Consider factors such as severity, impact, and exploitability when prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation.

6. Remediation Recommendations:
   - Provide recommendations and guidance for remediating identified security vulnerabilities, SSL/TLS issues, and misconfigurations. Offer practical advice on patching software, updating configurations, and implementing security best practices for web servers and SSL/TLS certificates.

7. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Document the findings, analysis, and remediation recommendations in a comprehensive report format suitable for stakeholders, developers, and security teams. Include detailed information about identified vulnerabilities, SSL/TLS issues, their potential impact, and recommended remediation steps. Save the scan results as text (txt) and comma-separated values (csv) files for future reference and analysis.
